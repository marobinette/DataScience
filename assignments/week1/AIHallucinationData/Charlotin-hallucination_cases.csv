Inordinate judicial resources were expended on reviewing cases cited by Plaintiff that did not exist. No doubt Plaintiff’s opponent in this litigation was forced to expend similar energies. Here, too, as noted, certain cases Plaintiff cited in support of her arguments stood for the opposite result from that which Plaintiff stated in her briefs. This kind of activity not only wastes precious and limited judicial resources, but it also drives up the cost of litigation unnecessarily for those who must defend against or seek to prosecute claims on behalf of paying clients, given the underpinnings of the American Rule that attaches to most civil litigation in this country."""

However, as Bell CJ observed in May v Costaras [2025] NSWCA 178 at [15], with whom Payne JA and McHugh JA agreed, in the context of considering the use of AI in the preparation of submissions, that “(a)ll litigants are under a duty not to misled the court or their opponent.” The reliance on unverified materials produced by generative AI does have the potential to misled the Court.102    Although the termed used in relation to erroneously generated references by AI is “hallucinations”, this is a term which seeks to legitimise the use of AI. More properly, such erroneously generated references are simply fabricated, fictional, false, fake and as such could be misleading.103    All persons appearing before the Court have a duty to verify that the case law and legislation referred to and relied on, is accurate and that such materials actually exist. The references in Ayinde at [85] and [86] and in Costaras at [14]-[15], to matters involving litigants who are acting in person who rely on AI generated material clearly supports the position that all are required to verify the submissions made to the Court. There are many publicly available legal research websites, some which are accessible without a fee. Further, and without attempting to be exhaustive, the Queensland Supreme Court library is open and available to the public.104    The use of generative AI to prepare submissions that may include fake authorities will nearly always introduce added costs, complexity and add to the burden of other parties and to the Court: Costaras at [16] and [49]. I gratefully adopt the observation from Ayinde at [9] that “(t)here are serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence in the justice system if artificial intelligence is misused.” The Court in Ayinde observed from [10] to [31] the existing guidance, regulatory duties of the profession, referrals and the Court’s powers. Matters which are within the Court’s own domain include in the most serious of cases contempt of Court. The observations in Ayinde at [26]-[28] regarding contempt of court are not limited to legal practitioners.105    As the reasons above demonstrate, the circumstances of this case involved many fake authorities, fabricated quotes and false propositions. It is unhelpful for the Court to be referred to, and for parties to rely on, such matters."""

That is a stroke of pure luck for these lawyers, and one that did not remediate the waste and harm their misconduct wrought.

Here an inexperienced junior solicitor was given the task of preparing document citations for an amended pleading, and did so while working remotely and without access to the documents to be cited. In attempting to cite the relevant documents she used an (apparently AI-assisted) research tool which she considered had produced accurate citations when she previously used it. And as soon as Massar Briggs Law was told of the false citations the problem was addressed. The junior solicitor and the principal solicitor have apologised or expressed their regret to the other parties and the Court, and there was no suggestion that they were not genuine in doing so.15    The junior solicitor took insufficient care in using Googe Scholar as the source of document citations in court documents, and in failing to check the citations against the physical and electronic copies of the cited documents that were held at Massar Briggs Law’s office. The error was centrally one of failing to check and verify the output of the search tool, which was contributed to by the inexperience of the junior solicitor and the failure of Mr Briggs to have systems in place to ensure that her work was appropriately supervised and checked.

Written heads are as important a memorial of counsel’s argument as oral argument and, for purely practical reasons, are often more heavily relied upon by judges.[...][95] In this case, counsel’s explanations bear out their submission that there was no deliberate attempt to mislead the court in relation to the use of incorrect case citations in the heads of argument.

He also indicated that he did not independently verify the citations as they were understood to reflect well established and widely accepted principles of law. In other words, the undeclared and unverified artificial intelligence had no impact, and the substantive legal argument was unaffected and supported by other cases.[39] I do not accept that this is permissible. The use of generative artificial intelligence is increasingly common and a perfectly valid tool for counsel to use; however, in this Court, its use must be declared and as a matter of both practice, good sense and professionalism, its output must be verified by a human. The Court cannot be expected to spend time hunting for cases which do not exist or considering erroneous propositions of law.[40] In fact, the two case hallucinations were not the full extent of the failure of the artificial intelligence product used. It also hallucinated the proper test for the admission on judicial review of evidence not before the decision-maker and cited, as authority, a case which had no bearing on the issue at all. To be clear, this was not a situation of a stray case with a variation of the established test but, rather, an approach similar to the test for new evidence on appeal. As noted above, the case relied upon in support of the wrong test (Cepeda-Gutierrez) has nothing to do with the issue. I note in passing that the case comprises 29 paragraphs and would take only a few minutes to review.[41] In addition, counsel’s reliance on artificial intelligence was not revealed until after the issuance of four Directions. I find that this amounts to an attempt to mislead the Court and to conceal the reliance by describing the hallucinated authorities as “mis-cited” Had the initial request for a Book of Authorities resulted in the explanation in the last letter, I may have been more sympathetic. As matters stand, I am concerned that counsel does not recognize the seriousness of the issue.""In the final order, the court added:""While the use of generative AI is not the responsibility of the responding party, it was not appropriate for the Respondent to not make any response to the Court’s four directions and Order. Indeed, assuming that the Respondent noticed the hallucinated cases on receipt of the written argument, it should have brought this to the attention of the Court.[...]Given that Applicant’s counsel was not remunerated for his services in the file, which included the motion on which the offending factum was filed and a motion for a stay of removal and, in addition, that I am also of the view that the Respondent’s lack of action exacerbated matters and it should not benefit as a result, I am ordering a modest amount of $100 to be payable by Applicant’s counsel personally."""

In that way, artificial intelligence has the potential to contribute to the cause of justice. However, accessing any beneficial use of artificial intelligence requires carefully understanding its limitations. For example, if merely asked to write an opposition to an opposing party’s motion or brief, or to respond to a court order, an artificial intelligence program is likely to generate such a response, regardless of whether the response actually has an arguable basis in the law. Where the court or opposing party was correct on the law, the program will very likely generate a response or brief that includes a false statement of the law.

I am satisfied that all of the judgments and rules referred to in the submissions of 21 May 2025 were misstated, non-existent, or both, and that Gen AI had been used to prepare these submissions.An example was the citation of a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales described as “Wu v Wilks” (I will not provide the citation given in full, as there is a risk of it being picked up as genuine by other Gen AI: Luck v Secretary, Services Australia [2025] FCAFC 26 at [14]).

Goins v. Father Flanagan's Boys Home,D. Nebraska,USA,2025-06-05,Pro Se Litigant,Implied,Fabricated citations and misrepresented authorities,Warning,,No,,,,""" This Court's local rules permit the use of generative artificial intelligence programs, but all parties, including pro se parties, must certify “that to the extent such a program was used, a human signatory of the document verified the accuracy of all generated text, including all citations and legal authority,” NECivR 7.1(d)(4)(B). The plaintiff's brief contains no such certification, nor does the plaintiff deny using artificial intelligence. See filing 27 at 9.From the Court's review of the plaintiff's brief, most citations are not hallucinatory. But the plaintiff undeniably cites to cases that do not support the stated legal proposition. For example, the plaintiff asserts that “courts must ‘accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.’ ” Filing 22 at 3. He attributes the quoted language to Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 588 F.3d 585, 595 (8th Cir. 2009). The quote is a boilerplate recitation of the standard on a motion to dismiss, and any number of cases contain that exact language—but not Braden, the case to which the plaintiff attributed the quote.The plaintiff characterizes the mismatched citations as “[t]ypographical errors or minor misstatements.” Filing 27 at 9. That may be true for some of the mistakes—for example, the case Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962) is correctly cited, and it immediately precedes a citation for the nonexistent “Foman v. Arnold,” which might be explained as a typographical error. See filing 22 at 13. But not all the mistakes are so innocent, such as the plaintiff's citation to the nonexistent “Brown v. Maple Tree Homes, Inc.,” purported to be a Nebraska case, the citation to which directs to a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision. Filing 22 at 12. This mistake resembles the hallucinatory citations seen in other cases, and is a mistake the plaintiff had an obligation to correct before filing his brief. See Strong v. Rushmore Loan Mgmt. Servs., LLC, No. 8:24-cv-352, 2025 WL 100904, at *6 (D. Neb. Jan. 15, 2025).The plaintiff also asserts that while the citations may be erroneous, the statements of law are not. The Court agrees that the plaintiff made no substantive misrepresentations of law, so striking the brief is not the appropriate remedy. However, the plaintiff should take notice of the fact that such conduct, if repeated, could subject him to sanctions, even as a pro se litigant. See Ferris v. Amazon.com Servs., LLC, No. 3:24-cv-304, 2025 WL 1122235, at *2 (N.D. Miss. Apr. 16, 2025); Rubio v. D.C., No. 23-cv-719, 2024 WL 4957373, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 3, 2024); Vargas v.

It serves to make a mockery of the judicial process. It causes an enormous waste of judicial resources to try to find cited cases that do not exist and to determine whether a cited authority is relevant or binding, only to determine that most are neither.In like fashion, Lucas' adversaries also must run to ground the nonexistent cases or address patently irrelevant ones. The adversaries must thus incur needless legal fees and expenses caused by Lucas' pervasive citations to nonexistent or irrelevant cases.[...]However, as previously noted Lucas appears to be judgment proof so monetary sanctions likely will not deter her from the abusive practices reflected in her filings and in her previously announced, consistently followed, abuse of the litigation proceedings created by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq. (“IDEA”). So, the Court must find some other way to protect the interests of justice and to deter Lucas from the abuses which have come to mark her approach to participation as a defendant in the judicial process.In this case, the most appropriate remedy is to strike Lucas' filings where they are burdensome by virtue of volume and exceed permitted page limits, where they are not cogent or understandable (when given the generous latitude afforded pro se litigants), and where they misrepresent the law by citing nonexistent or utterly irrelevant cases.""In a subsequent Opinion, the court declined to reconsider or review its findings, pointing out that:""To begin, it is unclear what Lucas means by ""contested"" citations. The citations that the Court found to not exist are not ""contested."" They simply do not exist. There is no contesting that fact because the Court checked each citation that was referenced in its MEMORANDUM OPINION, exactly as Lucas cited them (and through other research means), and could not find any citation that matched what Lucas cited. That research demonstrates that the Court'sfindings are, in fact, supported rather than ""[u]nsupported."" Id.Then, in no way did the Court ""wrongly assume[]"" that these citations to nonexistent legal authority were ""'fabricated' due to the use of generative AI."" Id. The Court meticulously checked every citation that it held did not exist in those decisions. Those decisions were not based on ""assumptions"" but, instead, on the fact that either (1) no case existed under the reporter citation, case name, or quotation that Lucas used, or (2) a case with the reporter citation did exist but was to an entirely different case than the one cited by Lucas and had no relevancy to the issues of this case. ECF No. 170, at 520. And, there was no incorrect assumption that those nonexistent legal authorities were generated, hallucinated, or fabricated by AI because Lucas admitted, on the record, to using AI when writing her filings with the Court. The fact that her citations to nonexistent legal authority are so pervasive, in volume and in location throughout her filings, can lead to only one plausible conclusion: that an AI program hallucinated them in an effort to meet whatever Lucas' desired outcome was based on the prompt that she put into the AI program. As the Court described in its MEMORANDUM OPINION, this is becoming an alarmingly prevalent occurrence commonto AI programs. Id. at 23-26. It is exceedingly clear that it occurred here.[...]The MOTION also complains that the Court did not give Lucas an ""opportunity to verify or correct citations."" Id.Wholly apart from the fact that it is the litigant's (pro se or represented) burden to verify citations, there is no reason to have accorded Lucas the opportunity to verify because the problem was extensive and pervasive across at least six filings. Moreover, the Court actually did what should have been done before the MOTION was filed by determining that those citations do not exist. No further verification is necessary. And, after a diligent search, if the Court could not find the legal authorities that Lucas purported to rely upon and present as real and binding, it is a folly to believe that Lucas' efforts at ""correction"" would have returned anything different. Further, she could have taken the opportunity in this MOTION to go through—citation by citation—and ""verify"" or ""correct"" them to demonstrate to the Court that its findings were, in fact, incorrect, rather than just baldly and without evidence claiming them to be so. She did not do that."""

Much of the brief appeared to be AI-written. The attorney who signed and filed the brief, acknowledged that the cited authorities did not exist and that much of the brief was drafted by AI.Ruling/SanctionThe Court found Counsel's conduct violated Rule 11.02(b) of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure, as fake case citations cannot support any legal claim and there's an affirmative duty to investigate the legal underpinnings of a pleading. The Court found no merit in Counsel's defense, noting that the substitute cases she offered did not support the legal contentions in the brief, and the brief demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of legal standards. The Court did not find her insinuation that another, accurate motion document existed to be credible.Although the Court considered summarily denying the County's motion as a sanction, it ultimately denied the motion on its merits in a concurrent order because the arguments were so clearly incorrect.The Court declined to order further monetary sanctions, believing its Order to Show Cause and the current Order on Sanctions were sufficient to deter Counsel from relying solely on AI for case citations or legal conclusions in the future. However, the Court referred the matter concerning Counsel's conduct to the Minnesota Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board for further review, as the submission of an AI-generated brief with fake citations raised questions regarding her honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer."

It is an entirely different thing, however, to rely on the output of a generative AI program without verifying the current treatment or validity—or, indeed, the very existence—of the case presented.

Just recently, this Court warned, in no uncertain terms, that alongside the blessings of artificial intelligence, one must take excellent care against its pitfalls; 'Eat its inside, throw away its peel' (Anonymous matter, paragraph 26; Association matter, paragraph 19). The applicant did state, clearly, that he used artificial intelligence, and in light of this, he further requested that if a 'technical' error occurred under his hand – it should be seen as a good-faith mistake, not to be held against him. I cannot accept such a request. It does not cure the problems of hallucinating artificial intelligence. Those addressing this Court, whether represented or unrepresented alike, bear the burden of examining whether the precedents they refer to - which are not a 'technical' matter, but rather the beating heart of the pleadings - indeed exist, and substantiate their claims. For this reason too - the request must be dismissed""(Translation by Gemini 2.5)."

Linde, Inc., No. 21-cv-01258, 2023 WL 2320117 (D. Or. Feb. 28, 2023)” in briefing. The court stated it could not locate the case in any major legal database or via internet search and noted this could trigger Rule 11 sanctions if not based on a reasonable inquiry. The ruling cited Saxena v. Martinez-Hernandez as a cautionary example involving AI hallucinations, suggesting the court suspected similar conduct here."

The judge clarified that this was not simply a mistaken citation or party confusion, but rather a reference to an entirely fictional judgment. The court explicitly stated: “It is not clear how such an error occurs, except through the use of artificial intelligence.”Ruling/SanctionThe court permitted the defendant to proceed with the third-party notice but ordered partial costs (₪1,200) to be paid to the plaintiff due to procedural irregularities. The judge demanded a formal explanation of how the fictitious citation was introduced, in order to prevent recurrenceKey Judicial ReasoningWhile the procedural error did not warrant barring the defendant’s claim against a third party, the court emphasized that referencing a fictional legal source is a serious issue requiring scrutiny. The opinion signals a growing judicial intolerance for unverified AI-assisted legal drafting in Israeli courts."
Bandla v. Solicitors Regulation Authority,UK,UK,2025-05-13,Pro Se Litigant,Google Search (Allegedly),At least 25 fabricated or non-existent case citations,"Application for extension of time refused; appeal struck out as abuse of process; indemnity costs of £24,727.20 ordered; permission to appeal denied",24727 GBP,No,,Natural & Artificial Intelligence in Law,/documents/331/Venkateshwarlu_Bandla_v._SRA_UK_May_13_2025.pdf,"AI UseBandla denied using AI, claiming instead to have relied on Google searches to locate “supportive” case law. He admitted that he did not verify any of the citations and never checked them against official sources. The court found this unacceptable, particularly from someone formerly admitted as a solicitor.Hallucination DetailsBandla’s submissions cited at least 27 cases which the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) could not locate.Bandla maintained summaries and quotations from these cases in formal submissions. When pressed in court, he admitted having never read the judgments, let alone verified their existence.Ruling/SanctionThe High Court refused the application for an extension of time, finding Bandla’s explanations inconsistent and unreliable. The court independently struck out the appeal on grounds of abuse of process due to the submission of fake authority. It imposed indemnity costs of £24,727.20. The judge emphasized that even after being alerted to the fictitious nature of the cases, Bandla neither withdrew nor corrected them.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court found Bandla’s conduct deeply troubling, noting his previous experience as a solicitor and his professed commitment to legal standards. It held that the deliberate or grossly negligent inclusion of fake case law—especially in an attempt to challenge a disciplinary disbarment—was an abuse requiring strong institutional response."
Ramirez v.

The resulting hallucinated cases were passed to Counsel, who filed them without verification. Four out of eight cited cases were found to be fictitious:London v. Polish Slavic Fed. Credit Union, No. 19-CV-6645Rosario v. 2022 E. Tremont Hous. Dev. Fund Corp., No. 21-CV-9010Paniagua v. El Gallo No. 3 Corp., No. 22-CV-7073Luna v. Gon Way Constr., Inc., No. 20-CV-893Ruling/SanctionThe court imposed a $1,000 sanction against Counsel and her firm. Counsel was ordered to serve the sanction order on her client and file proof of service. The court declined harsher penalties, crediting her swift admission, apology, and internal reforms.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court found subjective bad faith due to the complete absence of verification. It cited a range of other AI-related sanction decisions, underscoring that even outsourcing to a “diligent and trusted” paralegal is not a defense when due diligence is absent."
Jamisson Roriz de Santana Andrade v.

Combined with the inclusion of fictitious citations, this led the Court to conclude that AI had been used and not reviewed. The judge characterized this as reckless conduct.Hallucination DetailsClaimed violations of STF precedents including RE 464.867/SP and RE 226.855/RS, which were either inapplicable or misrepresentedClaimed Súmula Vinculante 6 said something entirely false (its actual content concerns military service remuneration)Cited judgments ARE 1.218.084 AgR and RE 328.111/DF as relevant when they were either misquoted or irrelevantCourt concluded these references were invented or misrepresented, “false statements intended to mislead”Ruling/SanctionRejected the complaint as manifestly inadmissibleFound that counsel likely used AI and submitted the petition without reviewOrdered notification to both the national and Bahia sections of the OABDeclared the petitioner litigated in bad faith under Article 80, V, of the Brazilian Civil Procedure CodeImposed a procedural penalty of double the initial court costsOrdered referral to dívida ativa (federal collections) if not paid."
Newbern v. Desoto County School District et al.,N.D. Mississippi (USA),,2025-05-12,Pro Se Litigant,Implied,Fabricated case law,"Case dismissed, in part as a sanction for fabrication of legal authorities",,No,Even pro se litigants cannot fabricate legal authorities in briefing. Citing non-existent precedent—especially in an attempt to meet the stringent “clearly established” burden under qualified immunity—undermines the adversarial process and may justify dismissal of claims or limitation of remedies.,,/documents/338/Newbern_v._Desoto_ND_Mississippi_USA_May_12_2025.pdf,"AI UseThe court found that several of the cases cited by the plaintiff in her briefing opposing Officer Hill’s qualified immunity defense did not exist. Although Newbern suggested the citations may have been innocent mistakes, she did not challenge the finding of fabrication. No AI tool was admitted or named, but the structure and specificity of the invented cases strongly suggest generative AI use.Hallucination DetailsThe fabricated authorities were not background references, but “key authorities” cited to establish that Hill’s alleged conduct violated clearly established law. The court observed that the fake cases initially appeared to be unusually on-point compared to the rest of plaintiff’s citations, which raised suspicion. Upon scrutiny, it confirmed they did not exist.Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed the federal claims against Officer Hill as a partial sanction for plaintiff’s fabrication of legal authority and failure to meet the burden under qualified immunity. However, it declined to dismiss the entire case, citing the interest of the minor child involved and the relevance of potential state law claims. It permitted discovery to proceed on those claims to determine whether Officer Hill acted with malice or engaged in other conduct falling outside the scope of Mississippi Tort Claims Act immunity.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court found that plaintiff’s citation of fictitious cases undermined her effort to meet the demanding “clearly established” standard. It rejected her claim that the fabrication was an innocent mistake and viewed it in light of her broader litigation conduct, which included excessive filings and disregard for procedural limits. "
Crypto Open Patent Alliance v. Wright (2),UK,UK,2025-05-12,Pro Se Litigant,Implied,Use of AI to generate verbose/repetitive documents; AI-generated false/non-existent legal citations,General Civil Restraint Order (GCRO) granted for 3 years; Case referred to Attorney General; Costs awarded to applicants.,100000 GBP,Yes,,,/documents/449/Crypto_Open_Patent_Alliance_v._Wright_UK_May_12_2025.pdf,"AI UseDr. Wright, after beginning to represent himself, repeatedly used AI engines (such as ChatGPT or similar) to generate legal documents. These documents were characterized by the court as ""highly verbose and repetitious"" and full of ""legal nonsense"". This use of AI contributed to filings containing numerous false references to authority and misrepresentations of existing law.Hallucination DetailsWhile the core issue in Dr. Wright's litigation was his fundamental dishonesty (claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto based on ""lies and ... elaborately forged documents"" ), the use of AI introduced specific problems. His appeal documents, bearing signs of AI creation, contained ""numerous false references to authority"". His later submissions also involved ""citation of non-existent authorities"". This AI-driven production of flawed legal arguments formed part of his broader pattern of disrespect for court rules and process.Ruling/SanctionMr Justice Mellor granted a General Civil Restraint Order (GCRO) against Dr. Wright for a three-year period. He found that an Extended CRO (ECRO) would be insufficient given the scope and persistence of Dr. Wright's abusive litigation. The court also referred Dr. Wright's conduct to the Attorney General for consideration of a civil proceedings order under s.42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981. Dr. Wright was ordered to pay the applicants' costs for the CRO application, summarily assessed at £100,000.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court found ""overwhelming"" evidence that Dr. Wright had persistently brought claims that were Totally Without Merit (TWM), numbering far more than the required threshold. This conduct involved extensive lies and forgeries across multiple jurisdictions and targeted individuals who often lacked the resources to defend themselves. The judge concluded there was a ""very significant risk"" that Dr. Wright would continue this abusive conduct unless restrained. The court noted his consistent contempt for court rules and processes, including his perjury, forgery, breach of orders, and flawed submissions (including those using AI). A GCRO was deemed just and proportionate to protect both potential future litigants and the finite resources of the court system"
Case No. 72079-11-24,Israel,Israel,2025-05-12,Lawyer,Unidentified,Multiple fictitious court rulings,"No immediate sanction imposed; the matter was referred to the Legal Department of the Court Administration for review and potential action, including referral to the Ethics Committee of the Israel Bar Association",,Yes,,,/documents/363/X_v._Y_Israel_May_12_2025.pdf,"AI UseCounsel explained that the hallucinated citations were included in a draft intended for personal legal research and learning, which was mistakenly filed with the court. This constituted an implicit admission that generative AI tools were involved.Ruling/SanctionWhile Judge Itay Katz did not impose personal costs, he referred the matter to the Legal Department of the Judicial Authority to determine whether further steps—including referral to the Israel Bar Association Ethics Committee—should be taken. The court emphasized this was done as a gesture of leniency with the hope that such behavior will not recur.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court referred to several other recent Israeli cases to underscore the growing recognition of AI hallucination risk in legal practice. It reiterated the requirement for attorneys to meticulously verify any citation before submission and warned that future similar instances may not receive such lenient treatment."
In re Thomas Grant Neusom,M.D. Florida,USA,2025-05-08,Lawyer,Unidentified,Multiple fictitious or misrepresented case citations,Suspension from practice before the Middle District of Florida for one year; immediate prohibition on accepting new federal matters; conditional reinstatement,,Yes,"Submitting fictitious or misrepresented legal citations—whether due to negligence, AI misuse, or deliberate conduct—is a serious violation of professional duties and justifies suspension. The use of generative AI does not mitigate the duty to verify legal content.",Natural & Artificial Intelligence in Law,/documents/332/Re_Thomas_Grant_Neusom_Florida_USA_May_8_2025.pdf,"(Grievance Committee Report available here.)AI UseNeusom told the grievance committee that he “may have used artificial intelligence” in preparing filings, and that any hallucinated cases were not deliberately fabricated but may have come from AI tools. The filings in question included a notice of removal and a motion for summary judgment. The judge later noted a pattern of citations inconsistent with established case law and unsupported by known databases.Hallucination DetailsCitations included cases that either did not exist or were grossly mischaracterized. Notably:Southern Specialties, Inc. v. Pulido Produce, Inc. – no such case found in Westlaw, Lexis, or PACERTrilogy Communications v. Times Fiber – cited in support of breach of contract when it was a patent matter involving no such principlesNeusom failed to produce the full texts of the cited cases when requested and instead filed a 721-page exhibit in violation of court orders.Ruling/SanctionThe court adopted the grievance committee’s recommendation and imposed a one-year suspension. Neusom is prohibited from accepting new federal cases in the Middle District of Florida during the suspension and must:Notify existing clients and the court of his suspensionFile a compliance affidavit within 30 daysComplete appropriate CLE and counseling programsRemain in good standing with the Florida BarApply for reinstatement only after certifying complianceKey Judicial ReasoningThe court found that Neusom violated Rules 4-1.3, 4-3.3(a)(3), 4-3.4(c), and 4-8.4(c) of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct. His failure to verify AI-generated content, compounded by noncompliance with orders and false statements to opposing counsel, demonstrated a pattern of recklessness and dishonesty. The court emphasized that federal proceedings require a high standard of diligence and that invoking AI cannot excuse failure to meet professional obligations."

The court referred to this as a product “created by artificial intelligence.”Hallucination DetailsThe prosecution cited a statute regarding institutional computer definitions which, upon investigation, did not exist in Israeli law. The judge conducted internet and database searches to confirm its nonexistence. The judge criticized the error, remarking: “If I thought I had seen everything in 30 years on the bench, I was mistaken”Ruling/SanctionThe judge declined to sanction the prosecution but strongly rebuked the conduct, calling it embarrassing and improper.Key Judicial ReasoningThe judge stressed that citing phantom laws undermines public confidence and judicial efficiency. Even absent malice, reliance on fictitious AI-generated legal references is unacceptable. The judgment did not penalize the prosecution but underscored the need for due diligence and warned of reputational damage."

Legal arguments must be grounded in verifiable precedent.",,https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-50728-u.html,"AI UseThe court observed that “some of the cases that plaintiff cites… do not exist,” and noted it had “tried, in vain,” to find them. While no explicit AI use is admitted by the plaintiff, the pattern and specificity of the fabricated citations are characteristic of LLM-generated hallucinations.Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed all five causes of action—including negligence, tortious interference, aiding and abetting fraud, declaratory judgment, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing—as either untimely or duplicative/deficient on the merits. It declined to impose sanctions but explicitly invoked Dowlah v. Professional Staff Congress, 227 AD3d 609 (1st Dept. 2024), and Will of Samuel, 82 Misc 3d 616 (Sur. Ct. 2024), to warn plaintiff that any future citation of fictitious cases would result in sanctions.Key Judicial ReasoningJustice Jamieson noted that while the court is “sensitive to plaintiff's pro se status,” that does not excuse disregard of procedural rules or the submission of fictitious citations. The court emphasized that its prior decision in related litigation in 2022 undermined plaintiff’s tolling claims, and that Executive Order extensions during the COVID-19 pandemic did not rescue otherwise-expired claims. The hallucinated citations failed to salvage plaintiff’s fraud and tolling theories, and their use was treated as an aggravating—though not yet sanctionable—factor."

The outline contained hallucinated citations and quotations, which were incorporated into the filed brief by colleagues at both Ellis George and K&amp;L Gates. No one verified the content before filing. After the Special Master flagged two issues, counsel refiled a revised brief—but it still included six AI-generated hallucinations and did not disclose AI use until ordered to respond.Hallucination DetailsAt least two cases did not exist at all, including a fabricated quotation attributed to Booth v. Allstate Ins. Co., 198 Cal.App.3d 1357 (1989). Misquoted or fabricated quotes attributed to National Steel Products Co. v. Superior Court, 164 Cal.App.3d 476 (1985). Several additional misquotes and garbled citations across three submitted versions of the brief. Revised versions attempted to silently “fix” errors without disclosing their origin in AI output.Ruling/SanctionThe Special Master (Judge Wilner) struck all versions of Plaintiff’s supplemental brief, denied the requested discovery relief, and imposed:$26,100 in fees to reimburse Defendant for Special Master costs$5,000 in additional attorney’s fees to DefendantTotal monetary sanction: $31,100, payable jointly and severally by Ellis George LLP and K&amp;L Gates LLPNo sanctions against individual attorneys due to candid admissions and remedial action, but strong warning issuedKey Judicial ReasoningThe submission and re-submission of AI-generated material without verification, especially after warning signs were raised, was deemed reckless and improper. The court emphasized that undisclosed AI use that results in fabricated law undermines judicial integrity. While individual attorneys were spared, the firms were sanctioned for systemic failure in verification and supervision. The Special Master underscored that the materials nearly made it into a judicial order, calling that prospect “scary” and demanding “strong deterrence.”"

However, the court found the citation pattern highly characteristic of generative AI hallucinations, including plausible-sounding but non-existent authority names and improper formatting. Counsel acknowledged a lack of adequate supervision and admitted that the cited authorities were never verified nor included in the bundle.Hallucination DetailsSeven cited authorities were found to be fictitious or mischaracterized, including:BWIA v.

None were available in legal databases or official archives, and no hard copies were ever submitted.Ruling/SanctionWhile the court awarded judgment for the Claimant on the breach of contract claim, it found the citation misconduct egregious and referred the matter to the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Association. The Court noted that hallucinated citations undermine judicial integrity and must be proactively prevented.Key Judicial ReasoningJustice Westmin James emphasized that lawyers must not submit unverifiable or fictitious authority, whether generated by AI or not. He underscored that the legal system depends on the accuracy of submissions, and that even unintentional use of hallucinated material violates the duty of candour and may constitute professional misconduct."

It noted that several citations in his complaint and show-cause response were plainly incorrect or irrelevant. While Moales did not admit AI use, the court cited Strong v. Rushmore Loan Mgmt.

Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946) as supporting the existence of a federal common law fiduciary duty—an inaccurate legal proposition. The court characterized such misuses as “the norm rather than the exception” in Moales’s submissions. It stopped short of identifying all misused authorities but made clear that the inaccuracies were pervasive.Ruling/SanctionThe complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(h)(3). Moales was permitted to file an amended complaint by May 28, 2025, but was warned that future filings must be factually and legally accurate.

The court rejected this explanation, finding the hallucinated decisions did not exist in any legal archive and could not plausibly arise from mere misnumbering. The court accepted the defendant’s assertion that the fabricated citations originated from generative AI.Hallucination DetailsOut of five rulings cited in the petition, three were not found in any legal database. Two additional cases were filed after the hearing, but neither matched the original citations or contained the propositions advanced in the pleading. The court found the overall drafting pattern aligned with generative AI hallucination phenomena.Ruling/SanctionJudge Merav Eliyahu dismissed the petition and imposed personal costs of ₪1,500 against Plaintiff’s counsel (payable to the state) and ₪3,500 (payable to the opposing party). She cited Supreme Court precedent and ethical commentary emphasizing the risks of hallucinated legal drafting. She emphasized that lawyers must not rely blindly on AI tools and must always verify the authenticity of legal authorities cited in pleadings.Key Judicial ReasoningThe judge found that legal pleadings are the “foundational documents of judicial proceedings” and must be “accurate, reliable, and competently drafted.” Submitting fictitious judgments constitutes not only a procedural abuse but an ethical breach. Even absent bad faith, failure to verify AI-generated legal content breaches a lawyer’s core obligations."

She also referred to three Supreme Court of Canada cases that do not exist. Her submissions go on to explain in detail what legal principles those non-existent cases stand for. Despite these deficiencies, the submissions are written in a convincingly legal tone. Simply put, they read like a lawyer wrote them even though the underlying legal analysis is often wrong. These are all common features of submissions generated by artificial intelligence."" [...]""25. I agree with Hung Long that there are two extraordinary circumstances here that justify compensation for its time. The first is Ms. Simpson’s use of artificial intelligence. It takes little time to have a large language model create lengthy submissions with many case citations. It takes considerably more effort for the other party to wade through those submissions to determine which cases are real, and for those that are, whether they actually say what Ms. Simpson purported they did. Hung Long’s owner clearly struggled to understand Ms. Simpson’s submissions, and his legal research to try to understand them was an utter waste of his time. I reiterate my point above that Ms. Simpson’s submissions cited a non-existent case in support of a legal position that is the precise opposite of the existing law. This underscores the impact on Hung Long. How can a self-represented party respond to a seemingly convincing legal argument that is based on a case it is impossible to find?26. I am mindful that Ms. Simpson is not a lawyer and that legal research is challenging. That said, she is responsible for the information she provides the CRT. I find it manifestly unfair that the burden of Ms. Simpson’s use of artificial intelligence should fall to Hung Long’s owner, who tried his best to understand submissions that were not capable of being understood. While I accept that Ms. Simpson did not knowingly provide fake cases or misleading submissions, she was reckless about their accuracy."""

The court noted this failure and declined to excuse the misconduct, though it stopped short of attributing it directly to AI tools.Hallucination DetailsThe court reviewed Plaintiff’s motion and found that some of the cited cases did not exist. Despite being ordered to show cause, Plaintiff responded only with general statements about her good faith and complaints about perceived procedural unfairness, without addressing the origin or verification of the fake cases.Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and independently dismissed it as a sanction for bad-faith litigation under Rule 11. It found Plaintiff’s conduct—submitting fictitious legal authorities and refusing to take responsibility for them—warranted dismissal, even if monetary sanctions were not appropriate. The court cited Mata v. Avianca, Morgan v. Community Against Violence, and O’Brien v. Flick as relevant precedents affirming the sanctionability of hallucinated case law.Key Judicial ReasoningJudge Hall held that Plaintiff’s conduct went beyond excusable error. Her submission of fabricated cases, refusal to explain their origin, and attempts to shift blame to perceived procedural grievances demonstrated bad faith.

The filings included at least seven entirely fictitious case citations. The court noted the imbalance: it takes a click to generate AI content but substantial time and labor for courts and opposing counsel to uncover the fabrications.Hallucination DetailsThe hallucinated cases included federal circuit and district court decisions, complete with plausible citations and jurisdictional diversity, crafted to lend credibility to Plaintiff’s intellectual property and employment-related claims. These false authorities were submitted both in the complaint and in opposition to Amazon’s motion to dismiss.Ruling/SanctionThe court found a Rule 11 violation and, while initially inclined to dismiss the case outright, chose instead to impose a compensatory monetary sanction. Amazon is entitled to submit a detailed affidavit of costs directly attributable to rebutting the false citations. The final monetary amount will be set in a subsequent order.Key Judicial ReasoningJudge Michael P. Mills condemned the misuse of generative AI as a serious threat to judicial integrity. Quoting Kafka (“The lie made into the rule of the world”), the court lamented the rise of “a post-truth world” and framed Ferris as an “avatar” of that dynamic. Nevertheless, it opted for the least severe sanction consistent with deterrence and fairness: compensatory costs under Rule 11."

The court noted:""29. However, our conclusion was that Mr Zzaman’s statement of case, written with the assistance of AI, did not provide grounds for allowing his appeal. Although some of the case citations in Mr Zzaman’s statement were inaccurate, the use of AI did not appear to have led to the citing of fictitious cases (in contrast to what had happened in Felicity Harber v HMRC [2023] UKFTT 1007 (TC)). But our conclusion was that the cases cited did not provide authority for the propositions that were advanced. This highlights the dangers of reliance on AI tools without human checks to confirm that assertions the tool is generating are accurate.Litigants using AI tools for legal research would be well advised to check carefully what it produces and any authorities that are referenced. These tools may not have access to the authorities required to produce an accurate answer, may not fully “understand” what is being asked or may miss relevant materials. When this happens, AI tools may produce an answer that seems plausible, but which is not accurate. These tools may create fake authorities (as seemed to be the case in Harber) or use the names of cases to which it does have access but which are not relevant to the answer being sought (as was the case in this appeal).There is no reliable way to stop this, but the dangers can be reduced by the use of clear prompts, asking the tool to cite specific paragraphs of authorities (so that it is easy to check if the paragraphs support the argument advanced), checking to see the tool has access to live internet data, asking the tool not to provide an answer if it is not sure and asking the tool for information on the shortcomings of the case being advanced. Otherwise there is a significant danger that the use of an AI tool may lead to material being put before the court that serves no one well, since it raises the expectations of litigants and wastes the court’s time and that of opposing parties."""

The court emphasized that it could not determine whether the mis-citations were the result of confusion, poor research, or hallucinated AI output—but the burden rested with the party filing them.Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, noting Plaintiff had already filed and withdrawn a prior version and had had full opportunity to amend.

Although no specific tool was named, the Court inferred use based on the stylistic pattern and total absence of real citations. Petitioner provided no clarification and ultimately sought to withdraw the petition once challenged.Hallucination DetailsThe legal authorities cited in the petition included:Case names and citations that do not exist in Israeli legal databases or official court archivesQuotations and doctrinal references attributed to rulings that were entirely fictitiousSystematic internal inconsistencies and citation errors typical of AI-generated legal writingThe Court made efforts to locate the decisions independently but failed, and the petitioner never supplied the sources after being ordered to do so.Ruling/SanctionThe Court dismissed the petition in limine (on threshold grounds), citing “lack of clean hands” and “deficient legal infrastructure.” It imposed a ₪7,000 costs order against the petitioner and referred to the growing body of jurisprudence on AI hallucinations. The Court explicitly warned that future petitions tainted by similar conduct would face harsher responses, including possible professional discipline.Key Judicial ReasoningJustice Noam Sohlberg, writing for the panel, observed that citing fictitious legal authorities—whether by AI or not—is as egregious as factual misrepresentation. ""there is no justification for distinguishing, factually, between one form of deception and another. Deception that would justify the dismissal of a petition due to lack of clean hands—such deception, whether of this kind or that—is invalid in its essence; both forms demand proper judicial response.

This was reportedly his first time using AI for this purpose.Hallucination DetailsEight out of nine case citations in the filed motions were non-existent or led to differently named cases. Another cited case number was real but belonged to a different case with a different judge. The legal standard description was also deemed ""peculiar"".Ruling/SanctionAfter defense counsel raised issues, the Judge issued an order to show cause. The plaintiffs' attorneys admitted the error, withdrew the motions, apologized, paid opposing counsel's fees related to the motions, and reported implementing new internal firm policies and training on AI use. Judge Rankin found Rule 11 violations. Sanctions imposed were: $3,000 fine on the drafter and revocation of his pro hac vice admission; $1,000 fine each on the signing attorneys for failing their duty of reasonable inquiry before signing.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court acknowledged the attorneys' remedial steps and honesty but emphasized the non-delegable duty under Rule 11 to make a reasonable inquiry into the law before signing any filing. The court stressed that while AI can be a tool, attorneys remain responsible for verifying its output. The judge noted this was the ""latest reminder to not blindly rely on AI platforms' citations""."

Five references were entirely fictional, 14 had mismatched case details, and 24 included invented quotes. Upon judicial inquiry, counsel admitted reliance on an unnamed website recommended by colleagues, without verifying the information's authenticity. The Court concluded that the errors were likely the product of generative AI.Ruling/SanctionThe High Court of Justice dismissed the petition on the merits, finding no grounds for intervention in the Sharia courts’ decisions. Despite the misconduct, no personal sanctions or fines were imposed on counsel, citing it as the first such incident to reach the High Court and adopting a lenient stance “far beyond the letter of the law.” However, the judgment was explicitly referred to the Court Administrator for system-wide attention.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court issued a stern warning about the ethical duties of lawyers using AI tools, underscoring that professional obligations of diligence, verification, and truthfulness remain intact regardless of technological convenience. The Court suggested that in future cases, personal sanctions on attorneys might be appropriate to protect judicial integrity."

The court described them as “fabricated” and considered them serious enough to potentially mislead the court.Ruling/SanctionWhile the 6th Civil Chamber temporarily suspended the reintegration order, it further imposed a 10% fine on the value of the claim for bad-faith litigation and ordered that a copy of the appeal be forwarded to the Santa Catarina section of the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB/SC) for further investigation.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court emphasized that the legal profession is a public calling entailing duties and responsibilities. It cautioned that AI must be used “with caution and restraint”. The chamber unanimously supported the sanction."

Though no separate sanctions motion was granted, the court's ruling incorporated the AI misuse into its reasoning and concluded that Saxena could not be trusted to proceed further in good faith.Key Judicial ReasoningCiting Morgan v.

Against Violence, the court reasoned that “courts do not make allowances for a plaintiff who cites to fake, nonexistent, misleading authorities.” Saxena’s refusal to acknowledge the fabrication compounded the issue.

This will apply to all disability pensions, irrespective of whether they are paid from a taxed or an untaxed source. The rebate recognises that disability pensions are paid as compensation for the loss of earning capacity and are not merely a form of retirement income.I have examined the Explanatory Memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992. I was unable to locate any paragraph in that document in the same or similar terms to the paragraph generated by Copilot. It did not contain a paragraph 2.20.It has been noted by others that AI bots are prone to hallucinations.[35] That appears to be what has happened here. It is my assessment that submitting unverified material generated by AI, is not consistent with a party’s duty to use their best endeavours to assist the Tribunal to achieve its statutory objectives. To expect the Tribunal to read and consider material which a party does not know is authentic impedes the Tribunal’s attempts to provide a mechanism of review that ensures that applications are resolved as quickly and with as little expense as a proper consideration of the issues permits.Nothing in the remainder of the applicant’s submissions altered my view that the untaxed element of the benefit should be taxed under Subdivision 301-B."""

He inserted this output into the brief without verifying the sources. Counsel later admitted this under affidavit, citing time pressure, health issues, and unfamiliarity with AI's risks. He noted that guidance from the NSW Supreme Court was only published after the filing.Hallucination DetailsThe 25 October 2024 submission cited at least 16 completely fabricated decisions (e.g. Murray v Luton [2001] FCA 1245, Bavinton v MIMA [2017] FCA 712) and included supposed excerpts from the AAT’s ruling that did not appear in the actual decision. The Court and Minister’s counsel were unable to verify any of the cited cases or quotes.Ruling/SanctionJudge Skaros ordered referral to the OLSC under the Legal Profession Uniform Law (NSW) 2014, noting breaches of rules 19.1 and 22.5 of the Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules. The Court accepted Counsel’s apology and health-related mitigation but found that the conduct fell short of professional standards and posed systemic risks given increasing AI use in legal practice.Key Judicial ReasoningWhile acknowledging that Counsel corrected the record and showed contrition, the Court found that the damage—including wasted judicial resources and delay to proceedings—had already occurred. The ex parte email submitting corrected materials, without notifying opposing counsel, further compounded the breach. Given the public interest in safeguarding the integrity of litigation amidst growing AI integration, referral to the OLSC was deemed necessary, even without naming Counsel in the judgment."

The court granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's response and imposed monetary sanctions on Pittman, requiring him to pay $3,852.50 in attorney's fees and $108.54 in costs to the defendant.

Counsel did not deny using AI, but claimed the system may have been corrupted or unreliable. The amended filing removed the false authorities.Hallucination DetailsThe court did not identify the specific fake cases but confirmed that “citations to non-existent cases” were included in Defendants’ original brief. Counsel’s subsequent filing corrected the record but did not explain how the citations passed into the brief in the first place.Ruling/SanctionJudge William Griesbach denied the motion for summary judgment on the merits, but addressed the citation misconduct separately. He cited Rule 11 and Park v. Kim (91 F.4th 610, 615 (2d Cir. 2024)) to underline the duty to verify. No formal sanctions were imposed, but counsel was explicitly warned that further use of non-existent authorities would not be tolerated.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court emphasized that even if the submission of false citations was not malicious, it was still a serious breach of Rule 11 obligations. Legal contentions must be “warranted by existing law,” and attorneys are expected to read and confirm cited cases. The failure to do so, even if caused by AI use, is unacceptable. The court accepted counsel’s corrective effort but insisted that future violations would be sanctionable."

Harris, 761 F. Supp. 409 (D.D.C. 1991)) and a nonexistent quotation. Although Francisco claimed he had not used AI, the court found the fabrication bore the hallmarks of an AI hallucination and rejected his explanations as implausible.Hallucination DetailsFrancisco cited and quoted from a wholly fictitious United States v. Harris case, which neither existed at the cited location nor contained the quoted material. Upon confrontation, Francisco incorrectly tried to shift the source to United States v. Broussard, but that case also did not contain the quoted text. Searches in Westlaw and Lexis confirmed the quotation existed nowhere.Ruling/SanctionThe Court formally sanctioned Francisco for degrading the integrity of the court and violating professional responsibility rules. Although monetary sanctions were not immediately imposed, the misconduct was recorded and would be taken into account in future disciplinary proceedings if warranted.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court emphasized that submitting fake legal authorities undermines judicial credibility, wastes opposing parties' resources, and abuses the adversarial system. Persistent refusal to candidly admit errors aggravated the misconduct. The Court explicitly cited Mata v. Avianca and other AI hallucination cases as precedent for sanctioning such behavior, finding Francisco’s case especially egregious due to repeated bad faith evasions after being given opportunities to correct the record."

The court explicitly concluded that O’Brien “generated his Reply with the assistance of a generative artificial intelligence program.”Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed the case with prejudice on dual grounds:The claims should have been raised as compulsory counterclaims in prior pending litigation and were thus procedurally barred under Rule 13(a)O’Brien submitted fake legal citations, failed to acknowledge the issue candidly, violated local rules, and engaged in a pattern of procedural misconduct in this and other related litigation. While monetary sanctions were not imposed, the court granted the motion to strike and ordered dismissal with prejudice as both substantive and disciplinary remedy.Key Judicial ReasoningJudge Melissa Damian found that the fabricated citations and O’Brien’s refusal to admit or correct them constituted bad faith. She referenced multiple prior instances where O’Brien had been warned or sanctioned for similar behavior, and emphasized that while pro se litigants may receive procedural leniency, they are not exempt from ethical or legal standards. Dismissal with prejudice was chosen as a proportionate sanction under the court’s inherent powers."
Kohls v. Ellison,Minnesota,USA,2025-01-10,Expert,GPT-4o,Fake Academic Citations,Expert Declaration Excluded,,No,AI errors shatter expert credibility; Duty of diligence extends to expert filings; Rule 11 may require asking experts re: AI use/verification.,Volokh,https://reason.com/volokh/2024/11/19/apparent-ai-hallucinations-in-misinformation-experts-court-filing-supporting-anti-ai-misinformation-law/,"AI UseProfessor Jeff Hancock, a Stanford University expert on AI and misinformation, used GPT-4o to assist in drafting an expert declaration submitted by the Minnesota Attorney General's office in defense of a state law regulating AI deepfakes in elections.Hallucination DetailsThe declaration contained citations to three non-existent academic articles, apparently generated when the AI misinterpreted Hancock's notes to himself (e.g., ""[cite]"") as prompts to insert references. Opposing counsel identified the fake citations.Ruling/SanctionProfessor Hancock admitted the errors resulted from unchecked AI use, explaining it deviated from his usual practice of verifying citations for academic papers, and affirmed the substance of his opinions remained valid. Judge Laura M. Provinzino found the explanation plausible but ruled the errors ""shattered his credibility"". The court excluded the expert declaration as unreliable, emphasizing that signing a declaration under penalty of perjury requires diligence and that false statements, innocent or not, are unacceptable.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court found it ""particularly troubling"" that the expert exercised less care with a court filing than with academic work. While not faulting the use of AI itself, the court stressed the need for independent judgment and verification, stating the incident was a reminder that Rule 11's ""inquiry reasonable under the circumstances"" might now require attorneys to ask witnesses about their AI use and verification steps. The irony of an AI misinformation expert falling victim to AI hallucinations in a case about AI dangers was noted."
Mavundla v.

The judge even ran prompts into ChatGPT and confirmed that the tool responded with fabricated support for the same fake cases used in the submission. Counsel blamed overwork and delegation to a candidate attorney (Ms. Farouk), who denied AI use but gave vague and evasive answers.Hallucination DetailsFabricated or misattributed cases included:Pieterse v. The Public Protector (no such case exists at cited location)Burgers v. The Executive Committee..., Dube v. Schleich, City of Cape Town v. Aon SA, Makro Properties v. Raal, Standard Bank v. Lethole — none found in SAFLII or major reportersCitations were often invented or misattributed to irrelevant decisions (e.g., a Competition Tribunal merger approval cited as support for service rules)The supplementary notice of appeal included misleading summaries with no accurate paragraph citations, and no proper authority was ever provided for key procedural points.Ruling/SanctionApplication for leave to appeal dismissed in fullLegal representatives ordered to pay costs of the 22 and 25 September 2024 appearances de bonis propriisJudgment referred to the Legal Practice CouncilJudge emphasized that the conduct went beyond the leniency shown in Parker v.

She held that “relying on AI technologies when doing legal research is irresponsible and downright unprofessional,” and emphasized that even ignorance of AI’s flaws does not excuse unethical conduct.

He had also submitted a document with fabricated citations in the lower court.Hallucination DetailsThe appellate brief contained eight fictitious case citations alongside legitimate ones. The court could not locate the cases and issued an order to show cause.Ruling/SanctionAl-Hamim admitted relying on AI, confirmed the citations were hallucinations, stated he failed to inspect the brief, apologized, and accepted responsibility. The court affirmed the dismissal of his claims on the merits. While finding his submission violated Colorado Appellate Rules (C.A.R. 28(a)(7)(B)), the court exercised its discretion and declined to impose sanctions.Key Judicial ReasoningFactors against sanctions included Al-Hamim's pro se status, his contrition, lack of prior appellate violations, the absence of published Colorado precedent on sanctions for this issue, and the fact that opposing counsel did not raise the issue or request sanctions. However, the court issued a clear and strong warning to ""the bar, and self-represented litigants"" that future filings containing AI-generated hallucinations ""may result in sanctions"". The court emphasized the need for diligence, regardless of representation status."
Duarte v. City of Richmond,British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal,Canada,2024-12-18,Pro Se Litigant,Implied,Fabricated citations,Warning,,No,,,/documents/571/Duarte_v._City_of_Richmond_Canada_18_December_2024.pdf,"Nathan Duarte, a pro se litigant, filed a complaint against the City of Richmond alleging discrimination based on political beliefs. During the proceedings, Duarte cited three cases to support his claim that union affiliation is a protected characteristic. However, neither the City nor the Tribunal could locate these cases, leading to the suspicion that they were fabricated, possibly by a generative AI tool. The court held:""While it is not necessary for me to determine if Mr. Duarte intended to mislead the Tribunal, I cannot rely on these “authorities” he cites in his submission. At the very least, Mr. Duarte has not followed the Tribunal’s Practice Direction for Legal Authorities, which requires parties, if possible, to provide a neutral citation so other participants can access a copy of the authority without cost. Still, I am compelled to issue a caution to parties who engage the assistance of generative AI technology while preparing submissions to the Tribunal, in case that is what occurred here. AI tools may have benefits. However, such applications have been known to create information, including case law, which is not derived from real or legitimate sources. It is therefore incumbent on those using AI tools to critically assess the information that it produces, including verifying the case citations for accuracy using legitimate sources. Failure to do so can have serious consequences. For lawyers, such errors have led to disciplinary action by the Law Society: see for example, Zhang v Chen, 2024 BCSC 285. Deliberate attempts to mislead the Tribunal, or even careless submission of fabricated information, could also form the basis for an award of costs under s. 37(4) of the Code. The integrity of the Tribunal’s process, and the justice system more broadly, requires parties to exercise diligence in ensuring that their engagement with artificial intelligence does not supersede their own judgement and credibility."""

The court could not find a single one in any judicial database and ordered counsel to produce them. When he failed, he admitted they were inauthentic. The only real cited case (Skok) did not support the petitioner’s position.Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed the petition after finding that: (i) the cited decisions were fabricated; (ii) the only valid case did not support the argument; and (iii) under Israel’s Bankruptcy Ordinance, child support debts are not dischargeable by default. Despite the state’s failure to respond, the judge ruled sua sponte and imposed ₪1,000 in costs for procedural abuse.Key Judicial ReasoningJudge Saharai held that even if the hallucinated cases were cited inadvertently, their submission constituted a grave failure to meet professional obligations. He emphasized that a court cannot function when presented with legal fictions dressed up as precedent. The decision cited the attorney’s duty under section 54 of the Bar Law (1961) and ethics rules 2 and 34."

COPA demonstrated that most of the authorities cited did not contain the quoted language—or were entirely unrelated. The judge agreed, noting these were likely ""AI hallucinations by ChatGPT.""Later on, the Court of Appeal declined permission to appeal (finding that ""Dr Wright’s grounds of appeal, skeleton argument and summary of skeleton argument themselves contain multiple falsehoods, including reliance upon fictitious authorities such as “Anderson v the Queen [2013] UKPC 2” which appear to be AI-generated hallucinations"").

Bar on further pro se filings in the underlying probate actions without review and signature of a Florida-barred attorney. Clerk directed to reject noncompliant future filingsKey Judicial ReasoningThe Court held that Gutierrez’s submission of fictitious legal authorities and failure to respond to the show cause order constituted an abuse of process.

The court stated it “bears some of the hallmarks of an AI response” and noted that the citations appeared to have been “invented by artificial intelligence (‘AI’).”Hallucination DetailsThe court could not locate the following cited cases:Ford v. District of Columbia, 70 F.3d 231 (D.C. Cir. 1995)Davis v. District of Columbia, 817 A.2d 1234 (D.C. 2003)Ward v. District of Columbia, 818 A.2d 27 (D.C. 2003)Reese v. District of Columbia, 37 A.3d 232 (D.C. 2012)These were used to allege a pattern of constitutional violations by the District but were found to be fabricated.Ruling/SanctionThe court denied Plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint and dismissed the federal claims with prejudice. No formal Rule 11 sanctions were imposed, but the court emphasized the importance of verifying legal citations, citing Mata v. Avianca as precedent for how courts have responded to similar AI-related misuse.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court noted that while AI may be a helpful tool for pro se litigants, its use does not relieve them of the obligation to verify that every citation is real. The submission of fictitious legal authorities, even if inadvertent, is improper and may warrant sanctions. Here, the repeated failure to plead a viable claim after multiple amendments led to dismissal with prejudice."

Also fabricated quotations attributed to real cases, including Morales v. SimuFlite, White v. FCI USA, Burton v. Freescale, among others. Several ""quotes"" did not appear anywhere in the cited opinions.Ruling/SanctionThe court imposed a $2,000 fine, ordered Monk to complete at least one hour of CLE on generative AI in legal practice, and mandated formal disclosure of the sanctions order to his client. It also permitted amendment of the defective filing but warned of the severity of the misconduct.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court emphasized that attorneys remain personally responsible for the verification of all filings under Rule 11, regardless of technology used. Use of AI does not dilute the duty of candor. Continued silence and failure to rectify errors after opposing counsel flagged them exacerbated the misconduct."

The expert could not recall the specific prompts used, nor could he explain Copilot's underlying sources or methodology. He claimed using AI tools was generally accepted in his field but offered no proof.Ruling/SanctionThe court had already found the expert's analysis unreliable on other grounds, but specifically addressed the AI use. The court attempted to replicate the expert's results using Copilot itself, obtaining different outputs and eliciting warnings from Copilot about the need for expert verification before court use. The court held, potentially as an issue of first impression in that court, that counsel has an affirmative duty to disclose the use of AI in generating evidence prior to its introduction, due to AI's rapid evolution and reliability issues. AI-generated evidence would be subject to a Frye hearing (standard for admissibility of scientific evidence in NY). The expert's AI-assisted calculations were deemed inadmissible.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court emphasized the ""garbage in, garbage out"" principle, stressing the need for users to understand AI inputs and processes. It stated that the mere fact AI is used does not make its output admissible; reliability must be established. The lack of transparency regarding the AI's process was a key factor in finding the evidence unreliable."

Fake quotations falsely attributed to those nonexistent decisions.

Although Mehlhorn is self-represented, pro se appellants “are bound by the same rules that apply to attorneys on appeal.” See Waushara County v. Graf, 166 Wis. 2d 442, 452, 480 N.W.2d 16 (1992). We could summarily dismiss this appeal as a sanction for Mehlhorn’s multiple and egregious rule violations. See WIS. STAT. RULE 809.83(2). Nevertheless, we choose to address the merits of Mehlhorn’s arguments as best as we are able, given the deficiencies in her briefing"""
Nitzan v. Adar BaEmakim Properties Ltd.,Magistrate Court,Israel,2024-08-13,Lawyer,Implied,Multiple fictitious quotations from alleged Supreme Court decisions,Matter referred to the Legal Department of the Court Administration,,Yes,,AI4Law,/documents/463/Nitzan_v._Adar_BaEmakim_Properties_Ltd_Israel_August_13_2024.pdf,"In response to a motion by the defendant (Adar BaEmakim Properties Ltd.), the plaintiff's counsel submitted a response that included several purported quotations from Israeli Supreme Court decisions to support his arguments.Judge Daniel Kirs discovered that these citations were problematic: party names did not match case numbers, decision dates were incorrect, and one cited judge was incorrect. Crucially, the quoted text did not appear in the actual decisions, even when counsel was ordered to and did produce copies of the judgments he claimed to have cited.The judge considered the counsel's conduct to be more severe than simply misattributing a minority opinion; it was the presentation of a series of non-existent Supreme Court rulings. He explicitly noted that Adv. Faris did not claim these were fabrications by an AI tool that he failed to check (unlike the Mata v. Avianca case). Instead, Adv. Faris maintained that he himself had prepared these ""summaries"" after reading the cases.Due to the severity of this conduct—presenting fabricated Supreme Court ""quotations"" and misrepresenting their origin—the judge ordered the matter to be referred to the Legal Department of the Court Administration for consideration of further action.Separately, the defendant's underlying request (to send clarification questions to a court-appointed expert) was granted. The judge found that the ""severe misconduct"" of the plaintiff's counsel constituted a ""special reason"" to allow this, even though the defendant had previously waived the opportunity. The plaintiff was ordered to pay the defendant NIS 600 for legal fees related to this part of the motion.(Summary by Gemini 2.5)"

No sanction imposed for this first occurrence, acknowledging pro se status and likely ignorance of AI risks.Key Judicial ReasoningReliance on nonexistent precedent, even by pro se litigants, is an abuse of the adversarial system.

Silent failure to contest fabrication allegations worsened the finding.Following show cause proceedings, the court declined to sanction counsel.Key Judicial ReasoningThe judge emphasized that AI use does not lessen the lawyer’s duty to ensure accurate filings. Fabricated cases and misquotes are serious Rule 11 violations. Attorneys are responsible for vetting everything submitted to the court, regardless of source.

The Court noted this explicitly and criticized the mechanical reliance on AI outputs without human verification or contextual adjustment.Hallucination DetailsChatGPT produced a list of luxury and exotic cars supposedly comparable to a Ferrari 812 Superfast. The Court found that mere AI-generated association of vehicles based on ""economic context and competition position"" is insufficient under EU law principles requiring real-world comparability from the perspective of an average consumer.Ruling/SanctionThe Court rejected the appellant’s valuation arguments wholesale. It stressed that serious, human-verified reference vehicle comparisons were mandatory and that ChatGPT lists could not establish the legally required comparability standard under Dutch and EU law (Art. 110 TFEU). No monetary sanction imposed, but appellant’s entire case collapsed on evidentiary grounds.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court reasoned that a list generated by an AI program like ChatGPT, without rigorous control or verification, is inadmissible for evidentiary purposes. AI outputs lack the nuanced judgment necessary to assess ""similar vehicles"" under Art. 110 TFEU and Dutch bpm tax rules. It underscored that the test is based on the perceptions of a human average consumer, not algorithmic proximity."

The court did not directly investigate the technological origin but cited the systematic errors as consistent with known AI-generated hallucination patterns.Hallucination DetailsTwo cited cases were completely nonexistent. Additionally, a dozen cited decisions were badly misrepresented, e.g., Hydrick v. Hunter and Wall v. County of Orange were cited for parent–child removal claims when they had nothing to do with such issues.Ruling/SanctionThe Ninth Circuit struck the appellants' opening brief under Circuit Rule 28–1 and dismissed the appeal.

He stated he believed Bard was a ""super-charged search engine"" and was unaware it could generate fictitious cases.Hallucination DetailsCohen provided three non-existent case citations generated by Bard to his attorney, David M. Schwartz (not the same Schwartz as in Mata), who included them in a court filing. There was a misunderstanding between Cohen and his attorneys regarding who was responsible for verifying the citations. The fake citations were discovered by Cohen's other counsel, Danya Perry, who disclosed the issue to the court. One fake citation involved a chronological impossibility.Ruling/SanctionJudge Jesse Furman identified the citations as fake and issued an order to show cause regarding sanctions against the attorney. However, Judge Furman ultimately declined to impose sanctions on Cohen himself, noting his non-lawyer status, his stated (though surprising) ignorance of generative AI risks, and the expectation that his licensed attorney should have verified the citations. The judge nonetheless described the incident as ""embarrassing"" for Cohen and denied his underlying motion on the merits.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court highlighted the importance of verifying AI-generated content and the responsibility of licensed attorneys to ensure the accuracy of filings, even when research suggestions come from clients. The incident further underscored the unreliability of generative AI for legal research if used without verification."

Instead, the appellant relied on generalized, unverifiable statements produced by ChatGPT to contest the capitalization factor and COVID-19 valuation discounts applied by the tax authorities.Ruling/SanctionThe Court refused to attribute any evidentiary value to the ChatGPT-based arguments. It found that without disclosure of the input prompts and verification of AI outputs, the content was legally inadmissible as probative material. However, no sanctions were imposed, likely due to the novelty of the misuse and the lack of bad faith.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court emphasized that judicial proceedings demand verifiable, fact-based arguments. AI outputs that lack transparency (particularly about the underlying prompt and methodology) cannot serve as a substitute for evidence. The judgment explicitly notes that reliance on ChatGPT statements without verifiability ""does not affect"" the Court’s reasoning or the tax authority's burden of proof."

The Court stressed that submission of fabricated legal authority is an abuse of the judicial system, regardless of pro se status.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court invoked Mata v. Avianca to reinforce that citing fake opinions is an abuse of the adversarial system. The opinion emphasized that self-represented parties are fully bound by Rule 55.03 (certification of factual and legal contentions) and the Missouri Rules of Appellate Procedure. The decision warned that the Court will not tolerate fraudulent or AI-hallucinated filings, even from non-lawyers."

The drafting was done by junior staff (an associate and two recent law school graduates not yet admitted to the bar) who used an unidentified AI system to locate supporting authorities. The supervising attorney signed the filings after reviewing them for style and grammar, but admittedly did not check the accuracy of the citations and was unaware AI had been used.Hallucination DetailsJudge Brian A. Davis noticed citations ""seemed amiss"" and, after investigation, could not locate three cases cited in the memoranda. These were fictitious federal and state case citations.Ruling/SanctionAfter being questioned, the supervising attorney promptly investigated, admitted the citations were fake and AI-generated, expressed sincere contrition, and explained his lack of familiarity with AI risks. Despite accepting the attorney's candor and lack of intent to mislead, Judge Davis imposed a $2,000 monetary sanction on the supervising counsel, payable to the court.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court found that sanctions were warranted because counsel failed to take ""basic, necessary precautions"" (i.e., verifying citations) before filing. While the sanction was deemed ""mild"" due to the attorney's candor and unfamiliarity with AI (distinguishing it from Mata's bad faith finding), the court issued a strong warning that a defense based on ignorance ""will be less credible, and likely less successful, as the dangers associated with the use of Generative AI systems become more widely known"".

Avianca fiasco.Ruling/SanctionThe court struck the offending reply papers from the record and ordered the attorney to appear for a sanctions hearing under New York’s Rule 130-1.1. Potential sanctions include financial penalties or other disciplinary measures.Key Judicial ReasoningThe court emphasized that while the use of AI tools is not forbidden per se, attorneys must personally verify all outputs. The violation was deemed ""frivolous conduct"" because the lawyer falsely certified the validity of the filing. The judge stressed the dangers to the judicial system from fictional citations: wasting time, misleading parties, degrading trust in courts, and harming the profession’s reputation."

She stated the cases were provided by ""a friend in a solicitor's office"" and acknowledged they might have been generated by AI. ChatGPT was mentioned as a likely source.Hallucination DetailsThe nine cited FTT decisions (names, dates, summaries provided) were found to be non-existent after checks by the Tribunal and HMRC. While plausible, the fake summaries contained anomalies like American spellings and repeated phrases. Some cited cases resembled real ones, but those real cases actually went against the appellant.Ruling/SanctionThe Tribunal factually determined the cited cases were AI-generated hallucinations. It accepted Mrs. Harber was unaware they were fake and did not know how to verify them. Her appeal failed on its merits, unrelated to the AI issue. No sanctions were imposed on the litigant.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Tribunal emphasized that submitting invented judgments was not harmless, citing the waste of public resources (time and money for the Tribunal and HMRC). It explicitly endorsed the concerns raised in the US Mata decision regarding the various harms flowing from fake opinions. While lenient towards the self-represented litigant, the ruling implicitly warned that lawyers would likely face stricter consequences.

Crabill, relatively new to civil practice, used ChatGPT to research case law for a motion to set aside judgment, a task he was unfamiliar with and felt pressured to complete quickly.Hallucination DetailsCrabill included incorrect or fictitious case citations provided by ChatGPT in the motion without reading or verifying them. He realized the errors (""garbage"" cases, per his texts) before the hearing but did not alert the court or withdraw the motion.Ruling/SanctionWhen questioned by the judge about inaccuracies at the hearing, Crabill falsely blamed a legal intern. He later filed an affidavit admitting his use of ChatGPT and his dishonesty, stating he ""panicked"" and sought to avoid embarrassment. He stipulated to violating professional duties of competence, diligence, and candor/truthfulness to the court. He received a 366-day suspension, with all but 90 days stayed upon successful completion of a two-year probationary period. This was noted as the first Colorado disciplinary action involving AI misuse.Key Judicial ReasoningThe disciplinary ruling focused on the combination of negligence (failure to verify, violating competence and diligence) and intentional misconduct (lying to the court, violating candor). While mitigating factors (personal challenges, lack of prior discipline) were noted in the stipulated agreement, the dishonesty significantly aggravated the offense."

Plaintiff was warned to comply with procedural rules and to submit a coherent, consolidated amended complaint, or face dismissal.Key Judicial ReasoningThe judge stressed that AI use does not absolve pro se litigants of procedural compliance. Litigants must ensure pleadings are coherent, concise, and legally grounded, regardless of technological tools used. Courts cannot act as de facto advocates or reconstruct fragmented pleadings."

City of Las Cruces"") and real case names with incorrect volume/reporting details (e.g., misattributed circuits or invented page numbers). The citations lacked verifiable authority and were flagged by the court as spurious upon review.Ruling/SanctionThe court dismissed several claims on substantive grounds but issued a sharp warning about the misuse of AI-generated legal citations. While no immediate sanctions were imposed, the judge explicitly referenced Mata v. Avianca and held this instance to be only the second federal case addressing AI hallucinations in pleadings. The plaintiff was cautioned that any recurrence would result in Rule 11 sanctions, including dismissal with prejudice.Key Judicial ReasoningThe opinion stressed that access to courts is not a license to submit fictitious legal materials. Rule 11(b) requires factual and legal support for all filings, and even pro se litigants must adhere to this baseline. The court emphasized judicial efficiency, fairness to the opposing party, and the reputational harm caused by false citations. The misuse of AI was implicitly treated as a form of recklessness or bad faith, not excused by technological ignorance"

Despite opportunities to explain, Thomas gave vague excuses about ""self-research"" and ""assumed reliability,"" without clarifying the sources - suggesting reliance on AI-generated content.Hallucination DetailsTen fake case citations systematically inserted across filingsFabricated authorities mimicked proper citation format but were unverifiable in any recognized databaseThe pattern mirrored known AI hallucination behaviors: fabricated authorities presented with apparent legitimacyRuling/SanctionThe Court dismissed the action with prejudice as a Rule 11 sanction. It emphasized that fake citations delay litigation, waste judicial resources, and erode public confidence. The Court explicitly invoked Mata v. Avianca for the broader dangers of AI hallucinations in litigation and found Thomas acted in bad faith by failing to properly explain the origin of the fabrications.Key Judicial ReasoningCiting fabricated cases (even if resulting from AI use or negligence) is sanctionable because it constitutes an improper purpose under Rule 11. Sanctions were deemed necessary to deter further abuses, with dismissal considered more appropriate than monetary penalties given the circumstances."
Ruggierlo et al. v. Lancaster,E.D. Mich.,USA,2023-09-11,Pro Se Litigant,Unidentified,At least three fabricated case citations,No sanction; Formal Judicial Warning,,No,Citing hallucinated cases wastes judicial resources and may result in sanctions; pro se status does not excuse fictitious legal filings,,https://www.damiencharlotin.com/documents/253/Ruggierlo_et_al._v._Lancaster_US_DC_Eastern_Michigan_September_11_2023.pdf,"AI UseLancaster, filing objections to a magistrate judge’s Report and Recommendation, cited several fabricated case authorities. The Court noted the possibility of reliance on a generative AI tool and explicitly warned Lancaster about future misconduct.Hallucination DetailsFabricated or mutant citations, including:Bazzi v. Sentinel Ins. Co., 961 F.3d 734 (6th Cir. 2020) — mutant citation blending two unrelated real casesMaldonado v. Ford Motor Co., 720 F.3d 760 (5th Cir. 2013) — nonexistentMalliaras &amp; Poulos, P.C. v. City of Center Line, 788 F.3d 876 (6th Cir. 2015) — nonexistentCourt highlighted that the majority of the cited cases in Lancaster’s objections were fake.Ruling/SanctionNo immediate sanction imposed due to pro se status and lack of prior warnings. However, the Court issued a pointed warning that citing ""made-up law"" could lead to significant sanctions, either in that Court or any other court to which the case might be remanded.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court emphasized that unverified, fabricated legal citations undermine the judicial process and waste both judicial and litigant resources. Even without clear evidence of malicious intent, negligence in checking citations is sanctionable. Rule 11 duties apply fully to pro se litigants."
Ex Parte Lee,Texas CA,USA,2023-07-19,Lawyer,Unidentified,3 fake case citations,No sanction; Judicial Warning; Affirmance of Trial Court Decision,,No,AI use does not excuse failure to verify citations; Rule 38.1(i) requires valid authorities and proper record citations,,https://www.damiencharlotin.com/documents/250/Ex_parte_Lee_Texas_CA_July_19_2023.pdf,"AI UseThe Court noted that the appellant's argument section appeared to have been drafted by AI based on telltale errors (nonexistent cases, jump-cites into wrong jurisdictions, illogical structure). A recent Texas CLE on AI usage was cited by the Court to explain the pattern.Hallucination DetailsThree fake cases cited. Brief also contained no citations to the record and was devoid of clear argumentation on the presented issues.Ruling/SanctionThe Court declined to issue a show cause order or to refer counsel to the State Bar of Texas, despite noting similarities to Mata v. Avianca. However, it affirmed the trial court’s denial of habeas relief due to inadequate briefing, and explicitly warned about the dangers of using AI-generated content in legal submissions without human verification.Key Judicial ReasoningThe Court held that even if AI contributed to the preparation of filings, attorneys must ensure accuracy, logical structure, and compliance with citation rules. Failure to meet these standards precludes appellate review under Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). Courts are not obligated to ""make an appellant’s arguments for him,"" especially where brief defects are gross."
Parker v. Forsyth NNO and Others,Magistrates' Court,South Africa,2023-06-29,Lawyer,ChatGPT,8 fictitious cases,Plaintiff’s claim dismissed; punitive costs awarded on an attorney-and-client scale for specific period due to AI-generated hallucinated case law,,No,,Natural & Artificial Intelligence in Law,https://www.damiencharlotin.com/documents/336/Parker_v_Forsyth_NNO_and_Others_South_Africa_June_29_2023.pdf,"AI UseThe plaintiff's attorneys used ChatGPT to generate case law supporting the proposition that a body corporate can be sued for defamation. They forwarded eight cases—none of which exist—to opposing counsel during a post-hearing exchange and were unable to produce them later. Counsel admitted in open court that ChatGPT had been the source.Hallucination DetailsFictitious cases included:Body Corporate of the Brampton Court v Weenen [2012] ZAGPJHC 133Body Corporate of Bela Vista v C &amp; C Group Properties CC [2009] ZAGPPHC 54Dolphin Whisper Trading 21 (Pty) Ltd v The Body Corporate of La Mer [2015] ZAKZPHC 23Bingham v City View Shopping Centre Body Corporate [2013] ZAGPJHC 77Body Corporate of Pinewood Park v Behrens [2013] ZASCA 89Body Corporate of Empire Gardens v Sithole [2017] ZAGPJHC 23Body Corporate of the Island Club v Cosy Creations CC [2016] ZAWCHC 182Body Corporate of Fisherman’s Cove v Van Rooyen [2013] ZAGPHC 43The court verified that the citations, parties, and contents were entirely fictitious.Ruling/SanctionThe plaintiff’s entire claim was dismissed on legal grounds unrelated to the hallucinations (a body corporate cannot be sued for defamation under South African law).Punitive costs were imposed on the attorney-and-client scale for the period between March 28 and May 22, 2023, during which the plaintiff’s legal team insisted such authorities existed. The court awarded 60% of standard costs to the defendants for the rest of the proceedings. No personal sanction or bar referral was issued due to counsel’s candor and the court's confidence that the error stemmed from “overzealous and careless” use of ChatGPT, not intent to misleadKey Judicial ReasoningThe court stressed that AI tools like ChatGPT cannot be trusted for legal citation without human verification. Submitting hallucinated cases—even indirectly—misleads opposing counsel, wastes court time, and undermines trust in legal process. The incident was used to underscore that “good old-fashioned independent reading” remains essential in legal practice."

Examples cited by the court include Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co., Ltd., Shaboon v. Egyptair, Petersen v. Iran Air, Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Inc., Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and Miller v. United Airlines, Inc.. When challenged by opposing counsel and the court, the attorneys initially stood by the fake cases and even submitted purported copies of the opinions, which were also generated by ChatGPT and contained further bogus citations.Ruling/SanctionJudge P. Kevin Castel imposed a $5,000 monetary sanction jointly and severally on the two attorneys and their law firm. He also required them to send letters informing their client and each judge whose name was falsely used on the fabricated opinions about the situation.Key Judicial ReasoningJudge Castel found the attorneys acted in bad faith, emphasizing their ""acts of conscious avoidance and false and misleading statements to the Court"" after the issue was raised. The sanctions were imposed not merely for the initial error but for the failure in their gatekeeping roles and their decision to ""double down"" rather than promptly correcting the record. The opinion detailed the extensive harms caused by submitting fake opinions. This case is widely considered a landmark decision and is frequently cited in subsequent discussions and guidance."

He prepared the appellant's case himself, although it appears that he may have had some assistance with later submissions (including, perhaps, from an artificial intelligence program such as Chat GPT). Neither form of submission made coherent submissions as to why the trial judge's decision was affected by material error or otherwise gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. Nor did the material sought to be adduced by Mr Nash as additional evidence on the appeal disclose any miscarriage of justice.[...]. There is otherwise no jurisdictional basis to transfer criminal proceedings under State law in this Court to the court of another State. The authorities cited by Mr Nash in support of such jurisdiction do not exist; they are fictitious.""The court dismissed the appeal, finding no merit in the grounds presented, and refused to admit additional evidence. No professional sanctions or monetary penalties were imposed as Nash was a pro se litigant."
